      <h2>Blue Cart Recycling Program Managed Competition Issue Paper</h2>
      <p>
        June 19, 2019 update CRC has created an issue paper with recommendations
        for evaluating the City of Chicago's managed competition program for
        Blue Cart Recycling. CRC recommends an independent audit of the past 8
        years of managed competition and details which data from the program
        should be made publicly available.

      <h2>The Chicago Recycling Coalition presents a new paper, entitled "Recycling
        Policies in Chicago and Beyond: Failures in Information Collection and
        Provision," by Professor Matthew Shapiro (IIT) and Graduate Student Matt
        Lithgow (DePaul)</h2>

        This paper assesses and evaluates the existing recycling
        metrics for Chicago and other comparable municipalities. The patchwork
        system of Chicago’s recycling collection limits our ability to calculate
        an accurate recycling rate for the city, and this is a function of the
        city’s limited access to and provision of recycling data. Municipalities
        must establish policies that make sense, enact laws that embody those
        policies, create a framework for accountability, and actually hold
        residents and businesses accountable. To this end, Chicago must provide
        recycling and composting services to everyone, recycling must be tracked
        and the attendant data must be made readily available, and its
        educational initiatives must be overhauled in order to decrease
        contamination of the recycling stream.
